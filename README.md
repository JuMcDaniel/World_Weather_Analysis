# World Weather Analysis

### Technology

This project consisted of using Jupyter notebook as the platform to perform Python data analysis.  I used gmaps api with overlay markers for locations of certain hotels.  

### Project

The purpose of this assignment is to be able to navigate use of APIs including the Weather Database and gmaps to progress our learning and development of code use.   

#### Weather Vacation data
First we used the data to determine the weather for multiple different hotel around the world with the weather data.  The data was manipulated to include prompts for determining a min and max temperature to only show the hotel within that temperature.  Then 4 hotels were chosen and a travel itinerary was developed as seen below.

This week was challenging due to the large data sets and using the “break” function was very helpful when determining if my code was correct.  Overall I enjoyed this projects to see how these maps are coded on a small scale to done day to the work of going to a large scale.
